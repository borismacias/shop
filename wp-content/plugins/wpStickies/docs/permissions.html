<h3>About permission control</h3>
<p>
	wpStickies made with perfect integration with your WordPress site,
	this made us possible for such important settings that user permissions.
	You can control who can create or modify stickies.
</p>

<h3>Custom capability</h3>
<p>
	If you want to share your stickies administration with other users, you can
	specify a custom capability for these users. They won't be able to modify plugin settings
	if you don't enabled the option for this, but they still will be able to review all the changes
	and accept or reject stickies on your pending list. You can find all the available capabilities
	on <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities#Capability_vs._Role_Table" target="_blank">this</a>
	page.
</p>

<h3>Pending list</h3>
<div>
	Because you can allow everybody to create stickies, but you may
	don't want them to post inappropriate content publicly, we created a pending
	list where you can review all the changes before they goes public.<br><br>

	You can customize the behaviour of this pending list, for example, if
	only trusted users can create new stickies, you can ignore entirely the
	pending list, so all the new stickies will be public by default.<br><br>

	You can also set which action should be taken when someone modify their
	own stickies. There are three options:<br>

	<ul>
		<li>Ignore pending list, all changes will be public instantly</li>
		<li>If the sticky was accepted previously, it will be public</li>
		<li>The sticky will be on the pending list again for another confirmation</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<h3>Do I have to accept my own stickies?</h3>
<p>
	The plugin is intelligent, so if you are an administrator, all changes will take place
	immidiatelly without any confirmation.</a>
</p>

<h3>The "wpStickies admins" group</h3>
<p>
	The plugin created a new user group for you, called "wpStickies admins". The members of this
	group has basic capabilities, much like the subscripbers. They aren't special, they just can create
	stickies if you choose it in your permission settings.
</p>

<h3>Restore removed stickies</h3>
<p>
	Rejecting a pending sticky or removing any of them won't delete it immidiatelly. These
	stickies still will be available in your "Restore" tab under the "Stickies" page. You can decide
	that you either restore or delete them permantently. In the meantime, they will be invisible.
